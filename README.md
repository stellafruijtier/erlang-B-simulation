# erlang-B-simulation

This project simulates an **Erlang B** system (also known as an **M/M/c/c queue**) using Python. It models a system with c servers, exponential interarrival and service times, and **no queue**, meaning that jobs are **blocked and lost** when all servers are busy

The simulation estimates the **blocking probability** under various arrival and service rates and compares it to the **theoretical** Erlang B formula.

Developed as part of **Simulation & Stochastic Modeling** coursework at **Rollins College**
